      <h2>What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?</h2>
      <p>
        I believe the purpose of the semantic tags is to add structure to the page definition with in the html code. This will add fluidity to the page code. I think the most important tags would be section, nav, and aside.
      </p>
      <h2>What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?</h2>
      <p>
        The browser starts at the top of the page and will display elements in order as it reads down.
      </p>
      <h2>What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?</h2>
      <p>
        We learned that a snippet is a piece of text that you can automate the insertion of. I think this would be very useful in defining common code blocks that you would have to type often.
      </p>
      <h2>What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?</h2>
      <p>
        I think the snippet definition was the toughest part. I think I should go back and work on the syntax of the snippets because there were many features that looked interesting.
