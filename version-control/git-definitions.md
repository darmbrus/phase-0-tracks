# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
  * Version control is a system of creating a time line of work and changes made to a set of files allowing you to review and revert across the timeline as needed.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
  * A branch is an alternate timeline and runs in parallel to the other timelines with in the version control system. This allows you to make changes and work out bugs independently with out fear of committing changes that may not be functional.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
  * A commit is a freeze point in time that you are able to return to. A good commit message will describe what was changed in each file and why it was changed.
* What is a merge conflict?
  * A merge conflict occurs when two branches are attempted to be merged but the same whole files or locations with in the files were changed independently. This conflict then needs to be resolved by the user or team.
