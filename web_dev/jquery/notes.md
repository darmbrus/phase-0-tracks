# jQuery
## The plan
1. Find simple example of jQuery in action.
* Attempt to create it on my own
* Attempt to add to the example that was not originally part of it
* Search for more advanced examples of jQuery
* Try out some tutorials

## What was effective
* I found that the most effective strategy for me was to get in and try some of the examples if found on my own test site. This forced me to really look at the syntax and understand what it was doing.
