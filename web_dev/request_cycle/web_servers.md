1. What are the major design philosophies of Linux.
  * Built on top of the unix-like.
  * Designed for portability and simplicity.
  * Each program does one thing well.

* What is a VPS?
  * A VPS or virtual private server is a computer that will run inside of a virtual environment.
  * These environments will often hold many instances of different VPS spanning across many physical machines.
  * VPS allow you to test your applications with out the fear of breaking something on your own machine while also allowing you to test the performance of your application on a separate host.
* Why is it a bad idea to run programs as root.
  * It is often considered a bad idea to run applications as root because the root user has full access to all files on the computer. Because of this there are not many safe guards in place in relation to the commands that you are able to run and you can easily modify files that you had not intended. 
  * i.e. the root user can delete all of the files off of a harddrive, including the OS
